# globetrotter

Visualize your trip! Add the places you visited and the modes of transit between sites - globetrotter will animate your path across the globe.

## Architecture

This is vanilla JavaScript, built using MapBox GL. If you're interested in testing it yourself, fire up your favorite local web server.

## Inspo

I have always loved the camera behavior when navigating with Apple maps - the way the camera bearing changes smoothly to frame the path ahead of you is very satisfying. I tried to replicate that behavior in globetrotter.

I also love the AllTrails app, and I think the 3d trail visualization feature is great. What if there was a mapping tool for visualizing your world travel?

## License

This was made by me, Evan Lauer, with help (especially camera geometry and following logic) from gpt5. It is licensed under the GNU GPL license. (Which begs the question: Shouldn't ALL AI-generated code be licensed under GPL? Lol.)
